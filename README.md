# 🤖 ROS 2 Manipulator with MoveIt 2 and Gazebo Simulation

This project showcases a custom-designed 3-DOF robotic manipulator controlled using `ros2_control`, motion planned via `MoveIt 2`, and fully simulated in **Gazebo**. Built on **ROS 2 Jazzy**, the system demonstrates real-time motion planning, execution, and visualization.
